## Testing
* ### Code Validation

  The **Rock Paper Scissors** site's HTML, CSS and JavaScript codes have been validated by the **W3C HTML Markup Valication**, **W3C CSS Validation** and **JSHint Validation** services by entering the site's URL address.
  * W3C Markup Validation - No errors found.
    
    ![HTML code](assets/readmeimg/w3c-html.jpg)


  * W3C CSS Validation - No errors found.

    ![CSS code](assets/readmeimg/w3c-css.jpg)

  * JSHint JavaScript Validation - One warning found.

    * Metrics:
  
      * ```There are 15 functions in the script file.```
      * ```Functions with the largest signature take 2 arguments, while the median is 0.```
      * ```Largest function has 19 statements in it, while the median is 6.```
      * ```The most complex function has a cyclomatic complexity value of 10 while the median is 2.```
  
    * One warning:

      ```56 Functions declared within loops referencing an outer scoped variable may lead to confusing semantics. (renderGame)```

      This warning is caused by the function declared within the **for loop** at line **56** in the script.js file. The function fires on the click event that loop through each of the elements that has a **class** attribute with the value of **choice**.
